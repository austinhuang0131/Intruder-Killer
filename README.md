# Intruder Killer (formerly called DSHbot)
This bot is used to detect intruders listed by Discord Server Hub and prevent raids as many as possible. [Click here to get the bot.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=186507386981318657&scope=bot&permissions=268435469) The 4 permissions are definitely required. BTW, the bot is female.

## Features
* Detects intruders joining your server! (But, she only detects when they join. If they've already joined before she joins, you need to remove them by yourself.)
  * She updates ban list automatically, from my website!
* Commands
  * `dshreport`: Calls our agents when your server get raided.
  * `dshabout`: Tells you about our bot.
  * `dshmeme`: Tells you some memes about this bot and austinhuang.
  * `dshservlist`: Gives you a list of servers she is in.

## Report to us
Before you type `dshreport`, you should have these things prepared **if you have already banned the intruders**:
* Screenshot (As many as possible) or Mee6 log (http://mee6.xyz, make sure that logs feature is enabled!)
* All intruders' usernames and IDs

If the intruders are not banned, or the message are still kept, disregard this section.

## Fake bot?
Because I have posted my code here, I believe some people we hate (Especially eychef#2947, biggest cheater) may copy the source code and make a fake one. So let me clarify it:
### Info
* Intruder Killer#9741
* 186507426302787584
* Owned by austinhuang#1076

## I have found a fake one!
Keep its username and ID. Report it in [issues](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/Intruder-Killer/issues), then ban it.

## To-Dos
* Automatically get logs when report.
