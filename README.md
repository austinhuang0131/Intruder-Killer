# Intruder Killer
This bot is used to detect intruders listed by Discord Server Hub and prevent raids as many as possible.

## Features
* Detects intruders joining your server!
  * ~~She updates ban list automatically, from my website!~~ It is permanently removed for a new beta feature.
* Commands
  * `@Intruder Killer report`: Calls her agents when your server get raided.
  * `@Intruder Killer about`: Tells you about herself. (Actually that command links here)
  * `@Intruder Killer meme`: Tells you some memes about herself and her owner, austinhuang.
* Permissions
  * Administrator: Just in case. It is suggested to keep this permission for her. **Optional.**
  * Manage Roles: After `dshreport`, her agents will come to the server. They'll execute a command that gives permission to ban intruders. **Optional.**
  * Ban Members: Ban intruders when they join.
  * Create Instant Invite: `dshreport`.

## Report to us
Before you type `dshreport`, you should have these things prepared **if you have already banned the intruders**:
* Screenshot (As many as possible) or Mee6 log (http://mee6.xyz, make sure that logs feature is enabled!)
* All intruders' usernames and IDs

If the intruders are not banned, or the message are still kept, disregard this section.

## Fake bot?
Because I have posted my code here, I believe some people we hate may copy the source code and make a fake one. So let me clarify it:

### Info
* Intruder Killer#9741
* 186507426302787584 is the user ID.
* Owned by austinhuang#1076
* Original avatar: http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57404785

## I have found a fake one!
Keep its username and ID. Report it in [issues](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/Intruder-Killer/issues), then ban it.

## To-Dos
* Automatically get logs when report.
* Different databases.
